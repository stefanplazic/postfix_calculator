# postfix_calculator
converting infix notation to postfix notation

The programm is written in Python 2.7. It uses the tokenizer with regular expression matching to recognize floating points numbers and integer number. It can 
recognize brackets and envalute them to see if they are in proper order. 
Basic arithmetic operations are suported with their priorities (like * / + - ^). 
First it converts expression to postfix notaction using stack, and after that it prints the result of expression. 
Input must be inside double quotation marks in order to work properly. 
If there are any error it will be printed, and offered user to type expression again.

Have fun!!
